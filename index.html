          <p>
            The Visual Modelling Group (VMG) at the University of Brighton is a
            research group that carries out empirical research, this Web Application was
            initially required to act as a &quot;CMS-like&quot; application. But as it progressed it
            became clear that a better idea is to separate the process of building a quiz
            and the Content Management System processes.
          </p>

            Building a quiz:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Only experimenters can build quizzes, therefore they have to login through this page.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/login.png" alt="screenshot showing login page" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Assuming the files which help build a reasearch are on the server already.
            Then the app needs to know where they are and which files are used.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
              <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/create.png" alt="screenshot showing a web form to start creating a quiz" />
          </div>
          <p>
            When the experiment files are found, the the app builds a quiz object in the database and
            loads some of the quiz&apos;s specifications in an editable format like a form.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/exp_general_setting.png" alt="screenshot of preloaded general settings form" />
          </div>
          <p>
            If everything is ok then the experimenter submits the form which leads them to checking tasks (questions) one by one.
            The process of checking tasks is separated into a task per page, where the image for the question is loaded alongside the
            the question itself, the answers and the right answer in a form a a form where they can all be changed.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/edit_task.png" alt="screenshot showing editing a task" />
          </div>
          <p>
            When all the tasks are checked, then the user (experimenter) is redirected back to the admin home-page
            where they can either deleted or keep the experiment, note that when an experiment is created, it is immediately
            available for participation
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/home_e_after.png" alt="screenshot of experimenters homepage after an experiment is created" />

        <section>
          <h2>Participation:</h2>
          <p>
            When a user opens the site they are presented with a number of experiments to take part in.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/home_after.png" alt="screenshot showing Mechanical Mind&apos;s home page" />
          </div>
          <p>
            If the user chooses to participate in one of the quizzes, clicking on the title of the quiz redirects them to
            a registration page. This registration is per user per quiz, therefore the data collected from the participant
            registration process is minimal, only relates to the quiz and the user can not be traced from it.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/reg_p.png" alt="screenshot showing participant registration form" />
          </div>
          <p>
            When a participant registered, in the background a data collection bucket is created to hold the data generated from
            their answers, then they are redirected to the first task or any task if random is enabled.
          </p>
          <p>
            All tasks (questions) have a timer attached to them if the participant does not answer the question in the time set
            by the general quiz settings, then the system automatically answers timed-out for them, and the process continues
            until all tasks are answered or timed out.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/task_p_no_timer.png" alt="screenshot of answering a question while timer is hidden" />
          </div>
          <p>
            On some quizzes timer is shown, counting down until it reaches 0 then the task changes to the next one.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/task_p_timer.png" alt="screenshot of answering a question while timer is shown" />
          </div>
          <p>
            When all the questions are answered, then the participant is redirected to the home page where the can take part in another quiz.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Data:</h2>
          <p>
            When an experimenter logs, they will see all all their experiments displayed as a list of anchor links.
            If any of these links are clicked, then they are redirected to another page where it shows the data collected
            from participations in a table format where the headers of the table are the tasks and each column contains
            a participant&apos;s answer.
          </p>
          <div class="explainer_img">
            <img src="screenshots/mechanicalmind/data_table.png" alt="screenshot showing the data represented in a table" />
          </div>
          <p>
            On this page there are also options to show the data in (CSV or JSON) format.
          </p>
