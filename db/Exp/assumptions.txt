- All is based on ripping data out of the flash experiment given by Andrew Blake

- Experiment configured as in "experiment" folder, iuncluding correctly numbered and cropped images
- Folder "existing" contains the original screenshots from a walkthrough of the flash app, also has the text file output
- Folder "export" contains a "|" delineated output that an experimenter might be able to get from the system
- - Uses "|" instead of "," in case the solution etc. uses a comma (","). "|" is less likely to appear in the tasks

- participant ID and experiment ID are automatically populat4ed into the system so does not need to be explicitly defined in the experiment

- Images are named after their index number in the respective tasks array
- - Alternatively could use an explicit task id?
- Images are all 800x800 png files
- Images have a white background

- Questions asking for number of people in a certain set does not need to then ask for the people's names. Keep it simple.
